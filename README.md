Heart Disease Prediction Project

Overview:
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease using machine learning techniques. The model is built using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier and is trained on a dataset containing various health-related parameters. A graphical user interface (GUI) is created using tkinter to allow users to input their health data and receive predictions on their heart disease risk.

Features:
Load and preprocess heart disease dataset (heart.csv),
Train an SVM classifier for prediction,
Evaluate the model's performance,
Provide a user-friendly GUI for inputting data and displaying predictions.

Requirements:
Python 3.x,
pandas,
numpy,
matplotlib,
seaborn,
scikit-learn,
tkinter
